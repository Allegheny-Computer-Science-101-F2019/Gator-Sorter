## Description of the work already completed
So far 5 different classes have been created; MainApp, BubbleSort, InsertionSort, SelectionSort, and Sorter. The BubbleSort, Sorter, and InsertionSort classes have been fully implemented and seem to be functioning correctly. The MainApp class has been implemented but is not functioning completely yet, as we are having trouble getting it to interact with gradle and the other classes properly. After a little bit of looking over the code we were able to get an array sent to the BubbleSort and have it sorted correctly. The SelectionSort class has not been implemented yet, but that is currently in progress and should be completed soon.

## Description of the steps that you will take to finish the project
-Getting the MainApp class to cooperate with gradle and the other classes.
-Figuring out how to implement the SelectionSort class.
-Correctly implementing the SelectionSort class.
-Implementing 2 more methods in the Sorter class, one to record the time of each sorter and, the other to explain    how each sorter works
-Troubleshooting any errors in the code.
-Running all the classes together and getting descriptive and correct output.

# Reflection by Declan Casey, Noor Buchi, Pedro Carmo, Nolan Thompson

## Overview of the source code and terminal commands that you used
In our coding process, we used three main Gradle commands in our terminal. The first command is `gradle run` which runs the main method in `MainApp.java` file. When this command is typed in the terminal, the program runs and the user is prompted for input. Additionally, the program displays output based on what the user chooses. Getting this command to run properly required us to access the gradle files and add the correct class directory. Additionally we had to make sure that classes were packaged and imported. Another command used was `gradle build`, which compiled the program and showed if there are any errors. It also displayed checkstyle issues and helped us in fixing them by pointing out the type of issue. Overall, this command was useful in helping us organize the program to meet Google's standards in coding Java. The last command used was `gradle test`. Although it was not used until JUnit test cases were fully implemented, it helped us make sure that the sorting methods are working properly as expected and returning correct output. In order to get this command to work, changes had to be made to the `build.gradle` file to allow the use of JUnit test suite. Aside from the commands used in the terminal windows, we looked back at some of the laboratory assignments where we reused some of the code there.

## Description of the challenges that you faced and how you resolved them
The main challenge at the beginning of this project was ensuring that all the classes are connected together and to the `MainApp` class where our main method exists. In order to do that, we had to make some changes to the directory of the main class in the gradle files. Reading through the gradle files was part of that challenge because we never had to do that in out class projects. After asking some of the technical leaders and comparing the files to previous projects, we understood what needs to be changed for the program to work. Changing the gradle files allowed us to connect all of the classes and implement the necessary JUnit test suite.

## Description of the way in which you and your team members shared the project work
Noor: My contribution to this project includes implementing the important `printWithSymbol` method that allowed us to explain the sorting algorithm as well as writing the JUnit test suite. I also worked with Declan on writing the proper explanation for every step of sorting as well as finding bugs and issues in the program. Additionally, Nolan and I collaborated in fixing the checkstyle issues in the project as well as completing the technical writing. Overall, each one of us had an important role in completing this project and ensuring that it is working without any issues.

Nolan: For contributing to this project I implemented most of the structure for the main method. I had it take in info from the user and then generate a random array then based on the users input sends the array to a certain class sorting the said array and showing how the array got sorted. I also helped fix checkstyle errors with Noor in the code, as we had over one-hundred different checkstyle errors across the program. To provide additional help I completed the update reflection file along with two parts of the report reflection.

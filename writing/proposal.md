# An Educational Approach to Sorting Algorithms

## Declan Casey, Noor Buchi, Pedro Carmo, Nolan Thompson

## Abstract: In this project, we create a program that interacts with the user and explains how several sorting algorithms operate. It also generates a random set of data and sorts the data structure using the chosen algorithm. Finally, it displays the time it took to sort and general information about the worst-case time complexity of the sorting algorithm.

## This program is intended to serve an educational purpose through helping us and other students understand some sorting algorithms work and their performance. It will allow the user to choose a sorting algorithm and will display a step-by-step description of the first few iterations of the sorting algorithm. The available sorting algorithms available at first are bubble sort, insertion sort. Moving forward, there will be additional algorithms added. The program will also include a timing feature that displays the time it took to sort the

# An Educational Approach to Sorting Algorithms

## Declan Casey, Noor Buchi, Pedro Carmo, Nolan Thompson

## Abstract: In this project, we create a program that interacts with the user and explains how several sorting algorithms operate. It also generates a random set of data and sorts the data structure using the chosen algorithm. Finally, it displays the time it took to sort and general information about the worst-case time complexity of the sorting algorithm.

## This program is intended to serve an educational purpose through helping us and other students understand how some sorting algorithms work and their performance. It will allow the user to choose a sorting algorithm and will display a step-by-step description of the first few iterations of the algorithm. The available sorting algorithms at first are bubble sort, insertion sort. Moving forward, there will be additional algorithms added. The program will also include a timing feature that displays the time it took to sort the data as well as information about the pros and cons of using this sorting method.

## Description of the Tasks:

- Create a sorter class
- Create different sorting algorithms that extend sorter
- Create a main method that prompts the user appropriately
- Add a timing method to the sorter class `sortToTime`
- Add an explanatory method to each sorter `explainSort`
- Create test cases that ensure all sorting algorithms work
- Handle all exceptions
- Implement scanner with conditional logic to get user input
- Document our progress through comments and update markdown files regularly
